## üêç Python Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python practice exercises, projects, and code snippets created to improve and reinforce my Python programming skills. It includes solutions to common coding problems, algorithm challenges, and small-scale projects.

### üîß Topics Covered

* Basic syntax and data types
* Control flow (if statements, loops)
* Functions and recursion
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* File handling
* Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.)
* Algorithms and problem-solving
* Modules and libraries (e.g., `math`, `random`, `datetime`)
* Practice problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars

### üìÅ Structure

Each folder or script is organized by topic or difficulty level. Comments and docstrings are added for clarity and learning purposes.
